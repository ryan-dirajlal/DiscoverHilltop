This is the source code to accompany a YouTube livestream from December 22nd 2020 – it’s a small but complete SwiftUI app for iOS, aimed at helping complete beginners take their first steps with Swift and SwiftUI.

You can watch the stream’s replay here: https://youtu.be/aP-SQXTtWhY

This project was built using Xcode 12.3, but should work fine in any Xcode from 12.0 onwards.
